Construct a spreadsheet that contains ten network devices (use Excel or Google 
Sheets). The CSV should at a minimum have the following columns: device_name, 
device_type, host, username, password. You can have additional columns. 

Save this spreadsheet as a CSV.

Use Python to process the file, each row should return a dictionary where the 
dictionary key is the entry from the first line. 

For example:
------------------
device_name, device_type, host, username, password
device1, cisco_nxos, 1.1.1.1, admin, admin
device2, cisco_iosxr, 2.2.2.2, admin, admin


Above the dictionary keys would be 'device_name', 'device_type', 'host', 
'username', and 'password' (i.e. the values from the header line).
